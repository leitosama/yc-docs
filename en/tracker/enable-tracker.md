# Enabling {{ tracker-full-name }}

If you are not using {{ tracker-full-name }} to manage issues in your company, you can enable it. To use {{ tracker-name }}, you need a [{{ yandex-cloud }}](../organization/) or [{{ yandex-360 }}](https://yandex.com/support/business/) organization. If you already have an organization, enable {{ tracker-name }} in it. If you have no organization, you can create it when enabling {{ tracker-name }}.

{% note warning %}

To enable {{ tracker-name }} for your organization, you need to have [administrator](role-model.md#admin) privileges.

If {{ tracker-name }} is already enabled for your organization, to start working with your issues, [log in to the service](user/login.md).

{% endnote %}

1. Log in to your [Yandex account]({{ link-passport }}). If you do not have an account, [create]({{ support-passport-create }}) one.

1. Go to the [page{{ tracker-name }}]({{ link-tracker-promo }}) and click **Try for free**.

1. If you are an administrator in one or more {{ yandex-cloud }} organizations, select the organization for which you want to enable {{ tracker-name }}, then click **Log in**.

   If you do not have a {{ yandex-cloud }} organization or want to create a new one, enter the name of the organization, add its description, then click **Create**.

   {{ tracker-full-name }} will be enabled for the selected or created organization automatically. For more information about managing organizations, see the [{{ org-full-name }}](../organization/) documentation.

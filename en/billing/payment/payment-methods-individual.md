# Bank card payments for individuals

Individuals can top up their personal account and pay for the resources they use with a [bank card](#debit-card) linked to their billing account.

## Linking a bank card {#pin-card}

When [creating](../quickstart/index.md) a billing account, you need to link a bank card.

{% include [payment-card-validation](../_includes/payment-card-validation.md) %}

You cannot unlink a bank card from an active billing account. Instead, you can [change the linked card](../operations/pin-card.md). If you delete the card linked to your {{ yandex-cloud }} billing account from [Yandex ID](https://passport.yandex.com/profile), your billing account may get locked (by changing its [status to `SUSPENDED`](../concepts/billing-account-statuses.md)) when debiting. You can [delete the card](../operations/pin-card.md#remove-card) only after you [inactivate the billing account](../operations/delete-account.md).

# {{ mos-name }} pricing

In this section, you can find {{ mos-name }} pricing [rules](#rules) and [effective prices](#prices) for the service's resources.


{% include [use-calculator](../_includes/pricing/use-calculator.md) %}

{% include [currency-choice](../_includes/pricing/currency-choice.md) %}


## Cluster status {#running-stopped}

Prices are applied differently depending on the cluster status:

* For a `Running` cluster, you pay both for the computing resources and storage size.
* For a `Stopped` cluster, you pay only for the storage size.


{% include [pricing-status-warning.md](../_includes/mdb/pricing-status-warning.md) %}



## What goes into the cost of using {{ mos-short-name }} {#rules}

The {{ mos-name }} usage cost is based on:

* Computing resources allocated to cluster hosts (including hosts with the `MANAGER` role).

* Disk type and disk space.

* Egress traffic from {{ yandex-cloud }}.

{% include [pricing-gb-size](../_includes/pricing-gb-size.md) %}

### Using cluster hosts {#rules-hosts-uptime}


The cost of host operation is determined by the allocated computing resources. Supported resource configurations are shown in the [Host classes](concepts/instance-types.md) section; vCPUs and RAM prices are quoted in the [Prices](#prices) section.

You can select host class both for hosts with the `DATA` role and hosts with the `MANAGER` and `DASHBOARDS` roles.



You are charged per hour of host operation. The minimum billing unit is a minute (for example, 1.5 minutes of host usage cost the same as 2 minutes). You are not charged for the time when the {{ OS }} host is not performing its main functions.

### Disk space usage {#rules-storage}

You are charged for the following:

* Storage allocated for clusters.

* Storage taken up by backups over specified cluster storage.

   * Backups are stored free of charge as long as the combined size of cluster data and all backups is smaller than the selected storage size.

   * When performing automatic backups, {{ mos-short-name }} does not create a new copy but saves the data changed from the previous backup. It means the storage space used by automatic backups only increases in proportion to the volume of changes.

   * The number of hosts in a cluster does not affect the storage size and, therefore, the free volume of backups.

The cost is specified for one month of use and based on 720 hours per month. The minimum billing unit is 1 GB per minute (for example, storing 1 GB for 1.5 minutes costs the same as storing 1 GB for 2 minutes).


## Discount for committed volumes of services (CVoS) {#cvos}

{% include [cvos](../_includes/mdb/cvos.md) %}

{{ mos-name }} provides two kinds of CVoS: on vCPUs and RAM on the hosts you plan to use in DB clusters. In the management console, you can see potential savings from using a CVoS at the current resource usage. You can also forecast your monthly payments for the desired number of vCPUs and RAM.

{% note info %}

You can use a CVoS to order certain types of resources. For non-supported resources, CVoS columns feature dashes under [Prices](#prices). Currently, you cannot order storage or web traffic this way.

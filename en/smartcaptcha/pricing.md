# {{ captcha-full-name }} pricing

{% include [use-calculator](../_includes/pricing/use-calculator.md) %}

## What goes into the cost of using {{ captcha-full-name }} {#rules}

You are charged for [{{ captcha-name }} API requests](./quickstart.md#check-answer) at `https://smartcaptcha.yandexcloud.net/validate`. You are only charged for [correct requests](concepts/validation.md#service-response) to which the API returns the `ok` status. These requests must meet the following conditions:

* {{ captcha-name }} identifies a request as one sent by a human and not a bot.
* The correct `secret` and `token` values are provided.
* The unique `token` was issued no more than 10 minutes ago.

{% note info %}

Using {{ captcha-name }} in [restricted mode](concepts/restricted-mode) is free of charge.

{% endnote %}

Examples of {{ captcha-name }} usage cost calculation:

1. The user has passed the CAPTCHA test resulting in a correct `/validate` request from the server. A fee will be charged.

1. The user has sent an empty or incorrect `token` resulting in an incorrect `/validate` request. No fee will be charged.

1. A backend developer has made a mistake and sent an incorrect `secret` or `token` in a response `/validate` request. The API will return an error in the `message` field. No fee will be charged.

1. An intruder has passed the CAPTCHA test, obtained the `token`, and sent it 10 times during the first minute. The API will return the `ok` status only to the first request, and you will be charged for the first request only.

1. An intruder has passed the CAPTCHA test, obtained the `token`, and sent it 10 times after 10 minutes. The API will return the `failed` status to all requests. You will not be charged for any of them.

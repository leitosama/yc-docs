# Getting information about a NAT gateway

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Management console {#console}

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the [folder](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder) containing your [NAT gateway](../concepts/gateways.md).
   1. Select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_vpc }}**.
   1. In the left-hand panel, select ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/arrows-opposite-to-dots.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.switch_gateways }}**.
   1. Select the NAT gateway you need.
   1. The **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.overview }}** page will display detailed information about the NAT gateway.

- CLI {#cli}

   {% include [include](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   1. View the description of the [CLI](../../cli/) command to get information about a [NAT gateway](../concepts/gateways.md):

      ```bash
      yc vpc gateway get --help
      ```

   1. Get information about your NAT gateway by specifying its name or ID:

      ```bash
      yc vpc gateway get <NAT_gateway_name_or_ID>
      ```

      Result:

      ```text
      id: enpkq1v2e7p0********
      folder_id: b1go79qlt1tp********
      created_at: "2024-04-23T16:34:53Z"
      name: test-gateway
      shared_egress_gateway: {}
      ```

- {{ TF }} {#tf}

   {% include [terraform-definition](../../_tutorials/_tutorials_includes/terraform-definition.md) %}

   {% include [terraform-install](../../_includes/terraform-install.md) %}

   To get information about a [NAT gateway](../concepts/gateways.md) using {{ TF }}:
   1. Add the `data` and `output` sections to the {{ TF }} configuration file:

      ```hcl
      data "yandex_vpc_gateway" "default" {
        gateway_id = "<NAT_gateway_ID>"
      }

      output "gateway" {
        value = data.yandex_vpc_gateway.default.created_at
      }
      ```

      Where:
      * `data "yandex_vpc_gateway"`: Description of the NAT gateway as a data source:
         * `gateway_id`: ID of the NAT gateway.
      * `output "gateway"`: Output variable that contains information about the NAT gateway creation time:
         * `value`: Returned value.

      You can replace `created_at` with any other parameter to get the information you need. For more information about the `yandex_vpc_gateway` data source parameters, see the [provider documentation]({{ tf-provider-datasources-link }}/datasource_vpc_gateway).
   1. Create resources:

      {% include [terraform-validate-plan-apply](../../_tutorials/_tutorials_includes/terraform-validate-plan-apply.md) %}

      {{ TF }} will create the required resources and display the output variable values in the terminal. To check the results, run:

      ```bash
      terraform output
      ```

      Result:

      ```text
      gateway = "2024-04-23T16:34:53Z"
      ```

- API {#api}

   To get detailed information about a [NAT gateway](../concepts/gateways.md), use the [get](../api-ref/Gateway/get.md) REST API method for the [Gateway](../api-ref/Gateway/index.md) resource or the [GatewayService/Get](../api-ref/grpc/gateway_service.md#Get) gRPC API call and provide the NAT gateway ID in the `gatewayId` request parameter.

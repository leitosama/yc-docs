# Connecting to a VM serial console via SSH

{% include [key-without-password-alert](../../../_includes/compute/key-without-password-alert.md) %}

After [enabling access](./index.md), you can connect to the serial console to interact with the [VM](../../concepts/vm.md). Before connecting to the serial console, carefully read the [{#T}](#security) section.

## Security {#security}

{% include [sc-warning](../../../_includes/compute/serial-console-warning.md) %}

For remote access, it is important to ensure protection against [MITM attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack). To do that, you can use client/server encryption.

To set up a secure connection:
* You can download the current [SHA256 fingerprint](https://{{ s3-storage-host }}/cloud-certs/serialssh-fingerprint.txt) of the SSH key before each connection to the VM.

   The first time you connect to the VM, the client sends the SSH key fingerprint to the server and awaits a decision on establishing a connection:
   * `YES`: Establish the connection.
   * `NO`: Reject.

   Make sure the fingerprint from the link matches the fingerprint received from the client.
* You can download the public [SSH key](https://{{ s3-storage-host }}/cloud-certs/serialssh-knownhosts) of the host before each connection to the serial console.

   Use the public SSH key you receive when connecting to the serial console.

   Recommended startup options:

   ```bash
   ssh -o ControlPath=none -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -o CheckHostIP=no -o StrictHostKeyChecking=yes -o UserKnownHostsFile=./serialssh-knownhosts -p 9600 -i ~/.ssh/<private_SSH_key_name> <VM_ID>.<username>@{{ serial-ssh-host }}
   ```

   The host's public SSH key may be changed in the future.

Check the specified files often. Download these files only via HTTPS after verifying the validity of the `https://{{ s3-storage-host }}` website certificate. If the website cannot securely encrypt your data due to certificate problems, the browser will warn you about that.

## Connecting to the serial console {#connect-to-serial-console}

{% note info %}

How the serial console works depends on the operating system settings. {{ compute-name }} provides a communication channel between the user and COM port on the VM, but it does not guarantee that the console works properly on the OS.

{% endnote %}

To connect to the VM, you need its ID. For information about how to get the VM ID, see [{#T}](../vm-info/get-info.md).

Your next steps depend on whether [OS Login](../../../organization/concepts/os-login.md) access is enabled for the VM. If OS Login access is [enabled](../vm-connect/enable-os-login.md) for the VM, you can connect to the serial console using an exported SSH certificate. SSH keys are used to connect to VMs with OS Login access disabled.

Some OSs may request user credentials for access to a VM. So you need to create a local user password before connecting to the serial consoles of such VMs.

{% list tabs %}

- With an SSH key

   1. Create a local user password on the VM:
      1. [Connect](../vm-connect/ssh.md) to the VM over SSH.
      1. {% include [create-serial-console-user](../../../_includes/compute/create-serial-console-user.md) %}
      1. Disconnect from the VM. To do this, enter the `logout` command.

   1. Connect to the VM.

      Connection command example:

      ```bash
      ssh -t -p 9600 -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -i <private_SSH_key_path> <VM_ID>.<username>@{{ serial-ssh-host }}
      ```

      Where:
      * `private_SSH_key_path`: Path to the private part of the [SSH key](../vm-connect/ssh.md#creating-ssh-keys) obtained when [creating the VM](../vm-create/create-linux-vm.md).
      * `VM_ID`: VM ID. For information about how to get the VM ID, see [{#T}](../vm-info/get-info.md).
      * `username`: Administrator name specified when creating the VM.

      ```bash
      ssh -t -p 9600 -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 fhm0b28lgfp4********.yc-user@{{ serial-ssh-host }}
      ```

      When connecting, the system may request a username and password to authenticate on the VM. Enter the username and password you created earlier to gain access to the serial console.

- With an SSH certificate via OS Login

   1. {% include [cli-install](../../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

      {% include [default-catalogue](../../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   1. Create a local user password on the VM:
      1. [Connect](../vm-connect/os-login.md) to a VM via OS Login.
      1. {% include [create-serial-console-user](../../../_includes/compute/create-serial-console-user.md) %}
      1. Disconnect from the VM. To do this, enter the `logout` command.

   1. Get a list of VMs in the default [folder](../../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder):

      {% include [compute-instance-list](../../_includes_service/compute-instance-list.md) %}

   1. {% include [enable-os-login-serial-console-auth](../../../_includes/compute/enable-os-login-serial-console-auth.md) %}

   1. [Export](../vm-connect/os-login-export-certificate.md) the OS Login certificate specifying your organization ID:

      ```bash
      yc compute ssh certificate export \
        --organization-id <organization_ID>
      ```

      Result:

      ```text
      Identity: /home/myuser/.ssh/yc-organization-id-bpfaidqca8vd********-yid-orgusername
      Certificate: /home/myuser/.ssh/yc-organization-id-bpfaidqca8vd********-yid-orgusername-cert.pub
      ```

      You can get the organization ID in [{{org-full-name}}]({{link-org-main}}) or using the `yc organization-manager organization list` CLI command.

      The exported certificate is valid for one hour.

   1. Connect to the VM.

      Connection command example:

      ```bash
      ssh -t -p 9600 -i <SSH_certificate_path> <VM_ID>.<OS_Login_username>@{{ serial-ssh-host }}
      ```

      Where:
      * `<SSH_certificate_path>`: Path to the exported SSH certificate, the value of the `Identity` field.
      * `<VM_ID>`: ID of the virtual machine whose serial console you want to connect to.
      * `<OS_Login_username>`: OS Login user ID in the organization. You can find the OS Login username at the end of the exported certificate name after the organization ID.
         You can also get the username in [{{org-full-name}}]({{link-org-main}}) in the user profile on the **{{ ui-key.yacloud_org.page.user.title_tab-os-login }}** tab.

      Example for a user with the `yid-orgusername` username and a VM with the `epd22a2tj3gd********` ID:

      ```bash
      ssh -p 9600 -i /home/myuser/.ssh/yc-organization-id-bpfaidqca8vd********-yid-orgusername epd22a2tj3gd********.yid-orgusername@{{ serial-ssh-host }}
      ```

      When connecting, the system may request a username and password to authenticate on the VM. Enter the username and password you created earlier to gain access to the serial console.

{% endlist %}

You can also connect to the serial console using [SSH keys for other users](../vm-connect/ssh.md#vm-authorized-keys).

### Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

* If you connect to the serial console and nothing appears on the screen:
   * Press **Enter**.
   * Restart the VM (for VMs created before February 22, 2019).
* If you see the `Warning: remote host identification has changed!` error when connecting with an SSH key, run the `ssh-keygen -R <VM_IP_address>` command.
* If you see the `Permission denied (publickey).` error when connecting with an SSH certificate, make sure OS Login authorization is enabled for the VM when connecting to the serial console and that the certificate is not expired. If required, enable OS Login authorization for the VM when connecting to the serial console or re-export the SSH certificate.

## Disconnecting from the serial console {#turn-off-serial-console}

To disconnect from the serial console:
1. Press **Enter**.
1. Enter the following characters in order: `~.`.

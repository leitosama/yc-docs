Sign up for {{ yandex-cloud }} and create a [billing account](../../billing/concepts/billing-account.md):
1. Go to the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) and log in to {{ yandex-cloud }} or create an account if you do not have one yet.
1. On the **[{{ ui-key.yacloud_billing.billing.label_service }}]({{ link-console-billing }})** page, make sure you have a billing account linked and it has the `ACTIVE` or `TRIAL_ACTIVE` [status](../../billing/concepts/billing-account-statuses.md). If you do not have a billing account, [create one](../../billing/quickstart/index.md).

If you have an active billing account, you can go to the [cloud page]({{ link-console-cloud }}) to create or select a [folder](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder) for your infrastructure to operate in.

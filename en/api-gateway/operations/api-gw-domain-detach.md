- API {#api}

   To disconnect a domain from an API gateway, use the [removeDomain](../apigateway/api-ref/ApiGateway/removeDomain.md) REST API method for the [ApiGateway](../apigateway/api-ref/ApiGateway/index.md) resource or the [ApiGatewayService/RemoveDomain](../apigateway/api-ref/grpc/apigateway_service.md#RemoveDomain) gRPC API call.

   Delete the resource record created when connecting the domain to the API gateway:

   * If your domain is delegated to {{ dns-name }}, use the [updateRecordSets](../../dns/api-ref/DnsZone/updateRecordSets.md) REST API method for the [DnsZone](../../dns/api-ref/DnsZone/index.md) resource or the [DnsZoneService/UpdateRecordSets](../../dns/api-ref/grpc/dns_zone_service.md#UpdateRecordSets) gRPC API call.

   * If a third-party DNS provider manages your domain, delete the record on the domain management page of your provider.

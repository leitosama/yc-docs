# Organization membership

[Organization](../quickstart.md) members are [users](../../overview/roles-and-resources.md#users) who belong to an organization and enjoy access to the services within it:

* [{{ yandex-cloud }} services]({{ link-cloud-services }})
* Collaboration and business intelligence services: [{{ tracker-full-name }}]({{ link-tracker }}), [{{ wiki-full-name }}]({{ link-wiki }}), [{{ forms-full-name }}]({{ link-forms-b2b }}), [{{ datalens-full-name }}]({{ link-datalens-main }}), and [{{ ml-platform-full-name }}]({{ link-datasphere-main }})

Non-members of an organization cannot gain access to the resources within the organization. An exception is the resources access to which is granted to the `{{ subjects-allUsers }}` and `{{ subjects-allAuthenticatedUsers }}` [system groups](../../iam/concepts/access-control/system-group.md).

Organization membership may be held by:

* Users invited to join an organization, upon acceptance of the invitation.
* Users of an [identity federation](./add-federation.md) created within an organization (they become members automatically).

# {{ mmg-name }} pricing

In this section, you can find {{ mmg-name }} pricing [rules](#rules) and [effective prices](#prices) for the service resources.

## What goes into the cost of using {{ mmg-short-name }} {#rules}

The {{ mmg-name }} usage cost is based on:

{% include [pricing-rules](../_includes/mdb/pricing-rules.md) %}

{% include [pricing-gb-size](../_includes/pricing-gb-size.md) %}

### DB host usage {#rules-hosts-uptime}

The cost is calculated for each hour of operation of the host in accordance with the allocated computing resources. Supported resource configurations are shown in the [Host classes](concepts/instance-types.md) section, while prices for using vCPUs and RAM are quoted in the [Prices](#prices) section.

The minimum billing unit is a minute (for example, 1.5 minutes of host usage cost the same as 2 minutes). You are not paying for the time when the {{ MG }} host is unable to perform its main functions.

### Disk space usage {#rules-storage}

You pay for the following:

* Storage allocated for DB clusters.


* Non-replicated SSD (`network-ssd-nonreplicated`) storage can only be ordered for clusters with three or more hosts, in increments of 93 GB.

   * You can only order local SSD storage (`local-ssd`) for clusters with three or more hosts:
      * For **Intel Broadwell** and **Intel Cascade Lake**: In increments of 100 GB.
      * For **Intel Ice Lake**: In increments of {{ local-ssd-v3-step }}.

   For more information about platform-specific storage limitations, see [{#T}](./concepts/storage.md).


* Space used by DB backups in excess of the storage amount specified for the cluster.

   * Backups are stored free of charge as long as the combined size of the DB and all backups is smaller than the selected storage size.

   * During an automatic backup, {{ mmg-short-name }} does not create a new copy but saves changes to the database compared to the previous copy. This means that the storage used by automatic backups increases only in proportion to the volume of changes that are made.

   * The number of hosts in a cluster does not affect the storage size and, therefore, the free volume of backups.

The cost is specified for one month of use and based on 720 hours per month. The minimum billing unit is 1 GB per minute (for example, storing 1 GB for 1.5 minutes costs the same as storing 1 GB for 2 minutes).

### Example of cluster cost calculation {#example}

The cost of using a cluster with the following parameters for 30 days:

* **{{ MG }} hosts**: 3 `s3-c2-m8` hosts: Intel Ice Lake, 2 × 100% vCPU, 8 GB RAM .
* **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mdb.forms.section_storage }}**: 100 GB of HDD network storage.

Cost calculation for {{ MG }} hosts:


> 
> 3 × (2&nbsp;×&nbsp;$0.012800 + 8&nbsp;×&nbsp;$0.007200) = $0.249600
> 
>
> Total: $0.249600 is the cost per hour of {{ MG }} host operation.


Where:
* 3 is the number of {{ MG }} hosts.
* 2 is the number of vCPUs.
* $0.012800 is the cost of using 100% vCPU per hour.
* 8 is the amount of RAM per {{ MG }} host (in GB).
* $0.007200 is the cost of using 1GB of RAM on 100% vCPU per hour.

Calculation for the storage cost and total cost:


> 
> 720 × $0.249600 + 100&nbsp;×&nbsp;$0.025600 = $182.272000
> 
>
> Total: $182.272000 is the cost of using the cluster for 30 days.


Where:
* 720: Number of hours in 30 days.
* $0.249600 is the cost per hour of {{ MG }} host operation.
* 100: Amount of HDD network storage (in GB).
* 0,025600&nbsp;$ is the cost of using 1 GB of network HDD storage per month.

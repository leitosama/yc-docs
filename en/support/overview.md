# Technical support procedure



{{ yandex-cloud }} provides technical support under different service plans. You can choose the one that best suits you. The cost of paid technical support plans includes two components: fixed and supplemental. The supplemental part is calculated as a percentage of the cost of resources consumed during the month. For more information about the plans, see the [Pricing policy](pricing.md).


## Contacting support {#response-time}



Depending on your service plan, you can contact technical support using one of these methods:

{% include [support-channels](../_includes/support/channels.md) %}

The expected response time is shown in the table below.

| Channel | Basic | Business | Premium |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|

Only {{ yandex-cloud }} [organization members](../organization/concepts/membership.md) can send requests to support. [Make sure](./support-center.md#before-you-begin) you are making a request on behalf of the right organization. If you have an issue with your infrastructure's production environment, specify _{{ ui-key.support-center.tickets.common.label_ticket-type-critical }}_ for the request type.

Regardless of your service plan, you can request the following from technical support:

* [Service logs](request.md#logs) related to your resources and actions in {{ yandex-cloud }}.
* [Your personal data](request.md#personal) stored by Yandex.

# Scenarios for getting started with {{ metadata-hub-full-name }} services

{% include notitle [preview](../../_includes/note-preview.md) %}

Manage connections to databases using {{ connection-manager-full-name }}. You will be able to [create](../operations/create-connection.md), [view](../operations/view-connection.md), [modify](../operations/update-connection.md), [delete the connections](../operations/delete-connection.md) created for your databases, and [manage access to them](../operations/connection-access.md).

Connections can be created:
* [Automatically](connection-manager.md#mdb-integration): To clusters with managed databases in {{ yandex-cloud }}.
* [Manually](connection-manager.md#database-connections): To user database installations or to clusters with managed databases in {{ yandex-cloud }}.

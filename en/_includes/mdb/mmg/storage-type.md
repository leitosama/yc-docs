When creating a cluster, you can select the following disk types for data storage:

* **Network HDD storage** (`network-hdd`): Most cost-effective option for clusters that do not require high read/write performance.
* **Network SSD storage** (`network-ssd`): Balanced solution. Such disks are slower than local SSD storage, but, unlike local disks, they ensure data integrity if {{ yandex-cloud }} hardware fails.
* **Non-replicated SSD storage** (`network-ssd-nonreplicated`): Network SSD storage with enhanced performance but without redundancy.

  The storage size can only be increased in 93 GB increments.


* **Local SSDs** (`local-ssd`): The fastest performing disks.

   The size of such a storage can be increased:
   * For **Intel Broadwell** and **Intel Cascade Lake**: Only in 100 GB increments.
   * For **Intel Ice Lake**: In {{ local-ssd-v3-step }} increments only.

   For a list of host classes and their respective platforms, see [Host classes](../../../managed-mongodb/concepts/instance-types.md).

# Backups in {{ mes-name }}

{% include [Elasticsearch-end-of-service](../../_includes/mdb/mes/note-end-of-service.md) %}

{{ mes-short-name }} supports automatic and manual [index](./indexing.md) backups.

A backup is automatically created every hour and stored for seven days. You cannot disable automatic backups or change the retention period.

To restore a cluster from a backup, follow [this guide](../operations/cluster-backups.md#restore).

## Creating backups {#size}

You can create backups both automatically and [manually](../operations/cluster-backups.md#create-backup). After a backup is created, it is compressed for storage. The exact backup size is not displayed.

Backups are only created on running clusters.

For more information about creating a backup manually, see [Managing backups](../operations/cluster-backups.md).

* Backups are stored in object storage as binaries.

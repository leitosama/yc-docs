# Creating configuration files and connecting to {{ ydb-short-name}}

{% note warning %}

For this tutorial, you need to install a {{ TF }} provider for {{ ydb-short-name }}. If you do not have a provider for {{ ydb-short-name }} installed, see [Installing and configuring {{ TF }} and the {{ ydb-short-name }} provider](./install.md).

{% endnote %}

Create a directory where you will place {{ TF }} configuration files for {{ ydb-short-name }}, then create a file named `main.tf`. For example:
```bash
mkdir ydb_terraform && cd ydb_terraform
touch main.tf
```

## Description of the provider section settings {#tproviders_description}

Add the following section to the beginning of the file and save the file:

```tf
terraform {
  required_providers {
    yandex = {
      source = "yandex-cloud/yandex"
    }
  }
  required_version = ">= 0.13"
}

provider "yandex" {
  zone = "{{ region-id }}-a" # Default availability zone
}
```

Values of the provider section fields:
* `source`: Global provider [source address](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/providers/requirements#source-addresses).
* `required_version`: Minimum {{ TF }} version the provider is compatible with.
* `provider`: Provider name.
* `zone`: [Availability zone](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md) where all cloud resources will be created by default.

To initialize the provider, run the `terraform init` command in the directory hosting the configuration files. In the terminal, you will see a message about successful installation. Now that {{ TF }} is installed and set up, you can start creating a [serverless](./serverless-database.md) or [dedicated](./dedicated-database.md) database.
